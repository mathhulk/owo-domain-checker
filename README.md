# owostat.us [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mathhulk/owostat.us.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mathhulk/owostat.us)
OwO uses a range of domains and services to provide their users with private file hosting. The purpose of owostat.us is to present the status of these services and domains to users.

owostat.us has been created with Node.js and uses a multitude of HTTP requests in order to attempt connections to OwO services and domains. OwO does not have a public website for displaying the status of their services and domains, thus the purpose that this project serves.
